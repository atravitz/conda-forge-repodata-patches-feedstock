# All versions of the pymc package above 2.x have an upper-bound
# (of 1.26) on the NumPy version. This patch introduces a (different)
# upper bound of (1.24) for 2.x because if the solver were to receive
# an otherwise unsolvably high version of NumPy, it would select the very
# deprecated 2.x.

# pymc v5 depends transitively on NumPy via PyTensor.
# pymc v4 depends transitively on NumPy via Aesara.
# pymc3 is a different package.
# pymc v2 is the subject of this patch.
# There is no v1 in this package.
